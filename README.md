# Hey there, I'm Jittiphat Rueangsawat (@bunnybavros) 🍃

I'm an enthusiastic learner and passionate about a few things - computers, coding, and operating systems. I'm always up for exploring and experimenting with the latest technology, especially when it comes to Hackintosh, WindowsOS, macOS, and Linux. Additionally, I love making music, specifically dubstep, which is another creative outlet I enjoy.

## Why I'm Here 📌

I created this GitHub account as a way to track my progress in learning new coding skills, and to showcase my projects to the world. GitHub is an excellent platform for collaboration and learning, and I'm excited to be a part of the community. By sharing my code and learning from others, I hope to become a better coder and contribute to the community.

## What I'm Up To 🌟

Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge of coding and specifically, exploring the vast possibilities of Python. I'm also interested in the configuration and modification of operating systems, which means I love to learn and experiment with different ways to optimize system performance. In my free time, you can catch me jamming out and making new beats.
